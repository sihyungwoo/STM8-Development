  @par Example description

  In some applications, it is recommended to power-on ADC1 only if it is required 
  since it can jeopardize battery life time if left powered-on continuously. 
  In this example, COMP2 is used to monitor the analog voltage while the MCU 
  is in halt mode and to wake-up the system if a predefined threshold is crossed.
  When the analog voltage crosses the threshold, the COMP2 is powered-off and
  ADC1 is powered-on to perform continuous conversion.

  MCU is switching between two modes: 
    - If analog voltage is above the internal reference voltage (VREFINT), 
      ADC1 is powered-on and continuous conversion is performed: the MCU 
      is in run mode and LD1 is ON.
    - If analog voltage is under VREFINT, ADC1 is powered-off and COMP2 is 
      powered-on, the MCU enters halt mode and LD2 is ON.

  COMP2 is configured as follow:
    - Inverting input is VREFINT: this is the selected threshold
    - Non Inverting input is connected to PD0
    - Edge detection configuration is rising edge

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Connect external voltage to PD0

  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Connect external voltage to PD0
  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
