  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure COMP2 peripheral to hold on safe state
  TIM1 inverted and non-inverted channels as soon as COMP2 output is set at high
  level.

  - COMP2 is configured as follow:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to DAC1 output
     - Non Inverting input is connected to PE5
     - Output is internally connected to TIM1 break

  - DAC1 is configured in 8-bit right alignment. DAC1 output = VREF * DOR / 256 
                                                              = 3.3 * 116 / 256 
                                                              = 1.5 V.

  - TIM1CLK is set to 2 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM1 counter
    clock used is 2 MHz.
    TIM1 frequency is defined as follow:
    TIM1 channels frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) = 30.52 Hz.

    The break Polarity is defined at high level so applying a voltage higher 
    than 1.5 V (DAC1 output = inverting input   on PE5 (non inverting input   sets
    the non-inverted channels and inverted channels in idle state: high level.

    A dead time of 58.5 µs is inserted between each two complementary channels:
    dead time = DEADTIME / TIM1CLK = 117 / 2 MHz = 58.5 µs.

    The selected lock level is level 1 so once programmed channels idle state, 
    break enable and polarity bits can no longer be written.

  - External voltage should be connected to PE5.

  - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM1 channels to display waveforms.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and 
      Medium-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density 
    devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL & STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Connect the external voltage to PE5
  - Connect TIM1 channels to an oscilloscope
