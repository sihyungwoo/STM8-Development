  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the COMP peripheral to exit MCU from Halt 
  mode.
  When the user presses the key push-button, the MCU enters Halt mode. 
  And when the comparator 1 non inverting input (which is connected to the
  potentiometer) exceeds the internal reference voltage which is set to 1.22V, 
  the comparator 1 causes the CPU to exit halt mode.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Before running the example make sure that potentiometer RV3 is at left position.

  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Before running the example make sure that potentiometer RV2 is at right 
       position and the JP7 is in key position.
  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c     (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - timing_delay.c      (under Utilities\Misc)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - The four LEDs are blinking
  - Press the key button to enter the CPU in halt mode, the four LEDs stop toggling
  - Rotate the potentiometer in order to make a rising edge
  - The CPU exits the halt mode and LEDs are blinking again
