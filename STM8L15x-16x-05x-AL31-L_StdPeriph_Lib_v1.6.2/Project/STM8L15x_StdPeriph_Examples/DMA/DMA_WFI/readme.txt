  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the DMA peripheral
  in circular mode to transfer data from USART peripheral to RAM memory. 
  When the user sends a character using USART, this character will be 
  transferred using DMA to a specific RAM buffer and a DMA interrupt is 
  generated by USART_RX.
  After configuring the DMA channel to transfer data (4 bytes   from USART data 
  register to a RAM buffer, the MCU enters to the WFI mode.
  While waiting the “DMA Transfer complete” event, the MCU is in WFI mode.
  As soon as the “DMA Transfer complete” event occurs, the MCU returns to run 
  mode, executes a specific action (activate/deactivate Leds   depending to the 
  Data in the RAM buffer and return to the WFI mode (by software  . 
  Since the DMA channel is configured in circular mode, the same procedure will 
  be repeated infinitely.
  Writing "led1" on HyperTerminal, will turn on LED1 and all the other leds will 
  be turned off.
  Writing "led2" on HyperTerminal, will turn on LED2 and all the other leds will 
  be turned off.
  Writing "led3" on HyperTerminal, will turn on LED3 and all the other leds will 
  be turned off.
  Writing "led4" on HyperTerminal, will turn on LED4 and all the other leds will 
  be turned off.
  Writing anything else than "led1", "led2", "led3" or "led4", will turn on all 
  leds.

 @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.   

  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - LED1, LED2,LED3 and LED4.
     - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
       CN1 and PC serial port.
     - Make sure that JP5 jumper is in RS232 position

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - LED1, LED2,LED3 and LED4.
     - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
       CN7 and PC serial port.
     - Make sure that JP5, JP11 and JP12 jumpers are in RS232 position

  - HyperTerminal configuration:
     - Word Length = 8 Bits
     - One Stop Bit
     - No parity
     - BaudRate = 9600 baud
     - flow control: None 
      

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
