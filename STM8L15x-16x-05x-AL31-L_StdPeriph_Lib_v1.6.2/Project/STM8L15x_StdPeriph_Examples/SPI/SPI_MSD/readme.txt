  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to make a communication
  (Write & Read data) between the SPI and a MicroSD memory card like the
  one present on STM8L152X-EVAL boards.
  
  First, Fill the Tx_Buffer with data to be written into the MicroSD memory 
  followed by a read of that data.
  Then data read from the MicroSD memory stored in the Rx_Buffer are compared
  with the expected values of the Tx_Buffer. The result of this comparison is 
  stored in the "TransferStatus" variable.

 @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - LED1..4
     - Plug a MicroSD memory card into the dedicated connector (CN15).
    
  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - LED1..4
     - Plug a MicroSD memory card into the dedicated connector (CN14).

  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required files:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - stm8_eval_spi_sd.c (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL\Common)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
   - If the program is pass the four LEDs are toggled, otherwise only LED1 toggles.
