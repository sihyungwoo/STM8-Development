  @par Example description
  This example shows how to retarget the C library printf/getchar functions
  to the USART. 
  This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART 
  and keep waiting a character to be entered by the user.

  The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Receive and transmit enabled
  
  @par Directory contents

  - USART/USART_Printf/main.c            Main file containing the "main" function
  - USART/USART_Printf/stm8l15x_conf.h   Library Configuration file
  - USART/USART_Printf/stm8l15x_it.c     Interrupt routines source
  - USART/USART_Printf/stm8l15x_it.h     Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up 
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
       CN7 and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP5 jumper is in RS232 position
    - Make sure that JP11 jumper is in RS232 position
    - Make sure that JP12 jumper is in RS232 position
    
  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
       CN1 and PC serial port.
     - Make sure that JP5 jumper is in RS232 position
    
  - HyperTerminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
