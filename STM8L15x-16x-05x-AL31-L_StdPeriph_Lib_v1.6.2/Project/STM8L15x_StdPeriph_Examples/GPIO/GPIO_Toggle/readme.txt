  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the GPIO peripheral to
  toggle Ports Pins infinitely.


  @par Directory contents

  - GPIO/GPIO_Toggle/main.c                   Main file containing the "main" function
  - GPIO/GPIO_Toggle/stm8l15x_conf.h          Library Configuration file
  - GPIO/GPIO_Toggle/stm8l15x_it.c            Interrupt routines source
  - GPIO/GPIO_Toggle/stm8l15x_it.h            Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up 
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 are already connected to PH0, PH1, PH2 and PH3

  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 are already connected to PA4, PA5, PA6 and PA7
 
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c    (Under Utilities\STM8_EVAL) 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
