  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the TIM4 peripheral 
  to generate time base equal to 1 ms. In this example a "Delay" function is 
  implemented based on the TIM4 time base.
  The four LEDs LD1..LD4 toggle with a timing defined by the Delay function.

  The TIM4CLK frequency is 16MHz, the Prescaler is 128 so the TIM4 counter 
  clock is 125 KHz.
  The TIM4 is running at TIM4 frequency = TIM4 counter clock / (TIM4_PERIOD + 1)   
                                        = 125000 / 125 = 1 KHz.
  So the TIM4 generates an Update Interrupt each 1 / 1000 = 1 ms.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1526-EVAL and STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Four leds LD1..LD4


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
