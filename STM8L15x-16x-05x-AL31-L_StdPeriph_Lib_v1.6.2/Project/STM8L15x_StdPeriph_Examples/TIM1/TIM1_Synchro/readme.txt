  @par Example description

  This example shows how to synchronize TIM1 and TIM2 & TIM3 using TIM1 update
  event.
  TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
   - PWM Mode 2 is used
   - TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output

  TIM2 and TIM3 are slaves for TIM1:
   - PWM Mode 2
   - Gated mode: so start and stop of slaves counters are controlled by 
     the Master trigger output signal(TIM1 update event  .

  TIM1CLK is set to 2 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 15 so the TIM1 counter
  clock used is 2MHz / 15 + 1 =  125 000 Hz
  TIM1 channel 1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) = 125 000 / 256 
                           = 488.28 Hz
  TIM1 channel 1 duty cycle equal to 100 * TIM1_CCR1_VAL / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) 
                                   = 100 * 127 / (255 + 1) = 50 %

  The TIM2 is running at:
  TIM2 channel 1 frequency = TIM1 channel 1 frequency / ((TIM2_PERIOD + 1)* (TIM1_REPTETION_COUNTER + 1))    
                           = 488.28 / (2 + 1) * (4 + 1))  
                           = 32.5 Hz
  TIM2 channel 1 duty cycle equal to 100 * TIM2_CCR1_VAL /(TIM2_PERIOD + 1)   
                                   = 100 * 1 / (2 + 1)   
                                   = 33.3%

  The TIM3 is running at:
  TIM3 channel 1 frequency = TIM1 channel 1 frequency / ((TIM3_PERIOD + 1) * (TIM1_REPTETION_COUNTER + 1))    
                           = 488.28 / ((3 + 1) * (4 + 1))    
                           = 24.41 Hz
  TIM3 channel 1 duty cycle equal to 100 * TIM3_CCR1_VAL /(TIM3_PERIOD + 1)   
                                   = 100 * 1 / (3 + 1)  
                                   = 25%

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and Medium-Density
      Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density
    devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL and STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect TIM1 channel 1, TIM2 channel 1 and TIM3 channel 1 to an oscilloscope:
     - TIM1 Channel 1 pin (PD2)  
     - TIM2 Channel 1 pin (PB0)  
     - TIM3 Channel 1 pin (PB1)  

  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
