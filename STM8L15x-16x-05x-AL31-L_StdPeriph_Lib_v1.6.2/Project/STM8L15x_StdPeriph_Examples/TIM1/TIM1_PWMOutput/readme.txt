  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three
  signals with three different frequencies.

  TIM1CLK = SYSCLK = 2 MHz
  TIM1 counter clock = TIM1CLK / Prescaler = 2MHz / 2 = 1 MHz

  The TIM1 CCR1 register value is equal to 32768: 
  CC1 update rate = TIM1 counter clock / CCR1Val = 30.51 Hz,
  so the TIM1 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to
  15.25 Hz.

  The TIM1 CCR2 register is equal to 16384:
  CC2 update rate = TIM1 counter clock / CCR2Val = 61.03 Hz
  so the TIM1 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 
  30.51 Hz.

  The TIM1 CCR3 register is equal to 8192:
  CC3 update rate = TIM1 counter clock / CCR3Val = 123.01 Hz
  so the TIM1 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 
  61.5 Hz.

  The TIM1 waveform can be visualized using an oscilloscope.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and Medium-Density
     Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density 
    devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL and STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope:
       - TIM1 Channel 1 pin (PD.2)  
       - TIM1 Channel 2 pin (PD.4)  
       - TIM1 Channel 3 pin (PD.5)  
  
  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Note that LED5 is toggling with two different colors (red and green)  
  - Connect the TIM1 channels to an oscilloscope to view the signals
