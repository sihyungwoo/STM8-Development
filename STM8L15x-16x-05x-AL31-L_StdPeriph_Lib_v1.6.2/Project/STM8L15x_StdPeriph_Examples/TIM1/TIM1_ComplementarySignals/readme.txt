  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three
  complementary signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the
  break feature and to lock the desired parameters.

  TIM1CLK is set to 2 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM1 counter
  clock used is 2 MHz.
  TIM1 frequency is defined as follow:
  TIM1 channels frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) = 30.52 Hz.

  The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description:

  TIM1 Channel1 duty cycle = CCR1_VAL / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) = 50%
  TIM1 Channel1N duty cycle = (TIM1_PERIOD - CCR1_VAL) / (TIM1PERIOD + 1) = 50%

  TIM1 Channel2 duty cycle = CCR2_VAL / (TIM1_PERIOD + 1) = 25%
  TIM1 Channel2N duty cycle = (TIM1_PERIOD - CCR2_VAL) / (TIM1PERIOD + 1) = 75%

  TIM1 Channel3 duty cycle = CCR3_VAL / TIM1_PERIOD = 12.5%
  TIM1 Channel3N duty cycle = (TIM1_PERIOD - CCR3_VAL) / (TIM1PERIOD + 1) = 87.5%

  The break Polarity is defined at low level so applying a low level on PD6
 sets the non-inverted channels and inverted channels in idle state: high level.

  A dead time of 58.5 µs is inserted between each two complementary channels:
  dead time = DEADTIME / TIM1CLK = 117 / 2 MHz = 58.5 µs.

  The selected lock level is level 1 so once programmed channels idle state,
  break enable and polarity bits can no longer be written.

  The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and Medium-Density 
    Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density
    devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL and STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect TIM1 channels pins to an oscilloscope as follows:
     - TIM1 Channel 1   pin (PD2)  
     - TIM1 Channel 1N  pin (PD7)  
     - TIM1 Channel 2   pin (PD4)  
     - TIM1 Channel 2N  pin (PE1)  
     - TIM1 Channel 3   pin (PD5)  
     - TIM1 Channel 3N  pin (PE2)  
    - Make sure that the MicroSD card is disconnected before running 
        the example (in case of using STM8L1526-EVAL).


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
    - Connect TIM1 channels pins to an oscilloscope
    - You can apply a low level on pin PD6 to set channels in idle state.
