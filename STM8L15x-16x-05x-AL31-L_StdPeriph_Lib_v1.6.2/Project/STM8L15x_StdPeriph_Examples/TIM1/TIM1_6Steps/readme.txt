  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 6 steps
  PWM which are used for motor control.
  The TIM1 peripheral offers the possibility to program in advance the 
  configuration for the next TIM1 outputs behaviour (step   and change the
  configuration of all the channels at the same time. This operation is possible
  when the COM(commutation) event is used.
  
  The COM event can be generated by software by setting the COM bit in the 
  TIM1_EGR register or by hardware (on TRC rising edge).
  In this example, a software COM event is generated each 180.2 ms: using the 
  TIM4 Update interrupt.
  The TIM1 is configured in Timing Mode, each time a COM event occurs, a new 
  TIM1 configuration will be set in advance.


The following Table describes the TIM1 Channels states:

  The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and Medium-Density
      Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density 
    devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL and STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect TIM1 channels pins to an oscilloscope as follows:
     - TIM1 Channel 1   pin (PD2)  
     - TIM1 Channel 1N  pin (PD7)  
     - TIM1 Channel 2   pin (PD4)  
     - TIM1 Channel 2N  pin (PE1)  
     - TIM1 Channel 3   pin (PD5)  
     - TIM1 Channel 3N  pin (PE2)  


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
   - Connect the TIM1 channels pins to an oscilloscope
