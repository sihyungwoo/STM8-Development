  @par Example description

  This example provides a small application in which joystick buttons are used 
  to trigger I2C communication and though using I2C firmware library.

   This example requires two boards(Master an Slave)  
   In master board, I2C peripheral is configured as Master Transmitter with Interrupt,
   where in Slave board, I2C peripheral is configured as Slave Receiver with Interrupt.
   According to the joystick button pushed in the master board a specific LED 
   will be put on in the slave board.
   At each joystick position pressure, a byte will be sent from master to slave to 
   command the LEDs lightening, and though as follow:
   
   - Joystick Right (Master board) --> led LD1 On and the Other leds are Off (Slave board)  
   - Joystick Left (Master board) --> led LD2 On and the Other leds are Off (Slave board)
   - Joystick Up (Master board) --> led LD3 On and the Other leds are Off (Slave board)
   - Joystick Down (Master board) --> led LD4 On and the Other leds are Off (Slave board)  
   
   Pressing joystick Select button will send a buffer which size is configurable, 
   and in the Slave board all Leds will be On.
   
   These operations can be repeated infinitely.
   
   Communication error are handled in both Master and Slave sides, their occurrence
   will be signaled respectively by puting On LED2 and LED5.
   A timer interrupt is generated at master side each 1ms to simulate load.
  
  The File "main.h" allows different possibilities of configuration of this example:
  - Addressing mode : 7-bit or 10-bit
  - I2C speed: Fast mode or Standard mode
  - Buffer size also can be configured

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.
  
  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up 
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Make sure that Jumper JP7 is set in poistion 1-2 (I2C position).
    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PC.01) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PC.01)  
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PC.00) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PC.00) 
    - Connect the two-boards grounds together

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up 
    - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PC.01) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PC.01)  
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PC.00) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PC.00) 
    - Connect the two-boards grounds together
  
  - Other platform Set-up
    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PC.01) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PC.01)  
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PC.00) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PC.00) 
    - Check that a pull-up resistor (4.7K) is connected on one I2C SDA pin
    - Check that a pull-up resistor (4.7K) is connected on one I2C SCL pin
    - Connect the two-boards grounds together
    @note The pull-up resitors are already implemented on the STM8L1528-EVAL and 
         STM8L1526-EVAL evaluation boards.    
    
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c    (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
