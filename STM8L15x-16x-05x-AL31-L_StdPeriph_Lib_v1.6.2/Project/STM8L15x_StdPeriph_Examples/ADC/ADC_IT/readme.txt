  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral
  to convert ADC Channel 3 input voltage in Interrupt mode.
  The ADC channel 3 converted voltage value is displayed on LCD.

  In the STM8L1528-EVAL board, ADC Channel 3 is connected to RV3 Adjuster. 
  Turning RV3 adjuster provides a voltage which can vary from 0 Volt to 3.3 
  Volt.
  In the STM8L1526-EVAL board, ADC Channel 3 is connected to RV2 Adjuster. 
  Turning RV2 adjuster provides a voltage which can vary from 0 Volt to 3.3 
  Volt.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
     For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - RV3 adjuster
     - LCD display.

  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
     For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - RV2 adjuster
     - LCD display.


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - stm8_eval_lcd.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL\Common)
    - timing_delay.c      (under Utilities\Misc)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Turn RV Adjuster to provide a varing voltage (from 0 Volt to 3.3 Volt  . The 
    ADC Channel 3 converted value is displayed on LCD.
