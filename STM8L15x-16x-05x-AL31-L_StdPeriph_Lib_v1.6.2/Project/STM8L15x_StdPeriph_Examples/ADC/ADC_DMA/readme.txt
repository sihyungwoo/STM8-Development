  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral
  to convert two ADC Channels input voltage using DMA.
  The ADC channel 3 and channel 24 converted voltage values are displayed on LCD.

  In the STM8L1528-EVAL board, ADC Channel 3 is connected to RV3 Adjuster and ADC 
  Channel 24 is connected to BNC connector CN2.
  In the STM8L1526-EVAL board, ADC Channel 3 is connected to RV2 Adjuster and ADC 
  Channel 24 is connected to BNC connector CN15.   

  Turning RV adjuster provides a voltage which can vary from 0 Volt to 3.3 Volt.
  The BNC connector may be connected to a DC Power supply voltage to provide
  a voltage from 0 Volt to 3.3 Volt.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus and 
  Medium-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density)
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
     For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - RV3 adjuster
     - BNC connector CN2
     - Dot matrix LCD
    
  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
     For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - RV2 adjuster
     - BNC connector CN15
     - Dot matrix LCD
     - Before Running the example make sure that jumper JP10 is in BNC position.
  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required files:
    - stm8_eval.c       (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - stm8_eval_lcd.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL\Common)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Turn RV Adjuster to provide a varing voltage (from 0 Volt to 3.3 Volt). The 
    ADC Channel 3 converted value is displayed on LCD.
  - Connect a Power supply varing voltage (from 0 Volt to 3.3 Volt) to the BNC 
    connector. The ADC Channel 24 converted value is displayed on LCD.
