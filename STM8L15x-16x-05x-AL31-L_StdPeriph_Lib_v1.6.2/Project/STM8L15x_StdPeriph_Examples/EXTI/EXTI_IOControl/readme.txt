  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the EXTI and GPIO 
  peripherals.
  When user presses a button, a LED will toggle and a message, indicating which
  button is pressed, is displayed on LCD.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Five leds LD1, LD2, LD3, LD4 and LD5 (bi-color led  
     - Key and Joystick buttons.
     - Dot matrix LCD
  
  - STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
      For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - Five leds LD1, LD2, LD3, LD4 and LD5 (bi-color led  
     - Key and Joystick buttons.
     - Dot matrix LCD
     - Make sure that the JP7 jumper is in key position.
    
    
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required files: 
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - stm8_eval_lcd.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL\Common)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example  
   - press KEY button, the bi-color led LD5 is on (green)and leds LD1 .. LD4 off
   - press joystick right button, led LD1 is on, LD5 is red and all other leds 
     are off
   - press joystick left button, led LD2 is on, LD5 is red and all other leds 
     are off
   - press joystick up button, led LD3 is on, LD5 is red and all other leds 
     are off
   - press joystick down button, led LD4 is on, LD5 is red and all other leds 
     are off
   - presses joystick select button, the bi-color led LD5 is green and leds LD1 
     .. LD4 on
