  @par Example description

  This example demonstrates how to switch the System clock from one source to another.
  
  To select a clock source, push the joystick as follow:
    - UP = HSE used as System clock source
    - RIGHT = HSI used as System clock source
    - DOWN = LSI used as System clock source
    - LEFT = LSE used as System clock source
  The selected clock source will be displayed on the LCD and the LEDs toggling 
  frequency will be changed according to the selected clock source.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM8L15x High-Density, Medium-Density Plus, Medium-Density
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L1528-EVAL 
    (STM8L15x High-Density devices) and STM8L1526-EVAL (STM8L15x Medium-Density and
    Low-Density devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    development board.

  - STM8L1528-EVAL and STM8L1526-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that the LCD glass daughter board is mounted in IO position.
       For more details please refer to the evaluation board user manual.
     - LD1..4
     - Joystick buttons.

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L15x_StdPeriph_Template
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required files:
    - stm8_eval.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL)
    - stm8_eval_lcd.c   (under Utilities\STM8_EVAL\Common)
    - timing_delay.c      (under Utilities\Misc)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
